\chapter*{Introduction}
This thesis is organized in three parts. In Part I, the first three chapters introduce Item Response Theory (IRT) and analyzes the novel parameter estimation method, ML2P-VAE. This method uses a modified variational autoencoder to estimation parameters in IRT models. Chapters 4-6 of Part II explore a task common in electroninc learning environments: knowledge tracing. While other deep learning methods for knowledge tracing lack interpretability, new methods presented here present a trade-off between prediction power and explainability. Part III explores two applications of the ML2P-VAE method in areas outside of education: sports analytics and health sciences.
