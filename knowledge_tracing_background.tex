\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Bayesian Knowledge Tracing}
*may not be important to go in-depth

\subsection{Deep Knowledge Tracing}
*should explain more because of DKT with Q-matrix

\subsection{Dynamic Key-Value Memory Networks}
*may not be important to go in-depth

\subsection{Performance Factors Analysis}
*should explain more, because of deep-pfa
